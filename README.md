# Awesome OSINT MCP Servers

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connects tools and services to LLM-systems like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc. When you request a task through the LLM, the MCP server engages the appropriate tool to perform it automatically.

MCP servers simplify the execution of a large number of OSINT tools, especially console-based ones, by combining it with the ease of querying in LLM and the ability to create flexible reports in LLM output.
